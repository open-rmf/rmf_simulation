1.0.0 (2020-06-24)
------------------
* Provides the `readonly` Gazebo plugin that emulates the behavior of a `read\_only` fleet type. When attached to a steerable vehicle that operates on a known traffic graph, the plugin publishes a prediction of the vehicle\'s intended path to the `rmf traffic database` via its configured `read_only_fleet_adapter`. Other fleets operating in the space can plan routes to avoid the path of this vehicle.
* Provides `TeleportDispenser` Gazebo plugin that is attached to the `TeleportDispenser` model in `rmf_demo_assets`. When loaded into Gazebo along side a \"payload\" model, the plugin will teleport the payload onto the nearest robot when it registers a `rmf_dispenser_msgs::DispenserRequest` message with `target_guid` matching its model name.
* Provides `TeleportIngestor` Gazebo plugin that is attached to the `TeleportIngestor` model in `rmf_demo_assets`. When loaded into Gazebo, the plugin will teleport the payload off the nearest robot and onto its location, when it registers a `rmf_dispenser_msgs::DispenserRequest` message with `target_guid` matching its model name.
